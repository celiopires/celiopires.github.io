						<h2><em>“A news website that Spain may need to keep an eye on”</em> by Peter Preston, The Guardian</h2>
					</div>

				<div class="intro__header--bio">
					<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.elespanol.com/">El Español</a> is an online daily news page launched in October 2015 after raising more than €3 million in a crowdfunding campaign. It operates from Madrid (Spain) as an independent source of news and it publishes primarily breaking news, generalist content, long in-depth articles, video coverage, picture galleries, blogs, interactive articles and interactive charts for electoral campaigns.</p>
					<p>Led by <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/pedroj_ramirez">Pedro J. Ramirez</a> former director of El Mundo, journalist, entrepreneur and one of the most influential persons in the country. At the age of 64 years old he was laid off from the company he founded in 1989 which currently is one of the most popular news sources with roughly 100 million unique users monthly and turned all his attention to setting up a new media company El Español along with a few high-ranking editors from other news organizations including El Mundo, El País or Huffington to reveal meaningful information mainly about Spain’s political actions.</p>
					<p>By March 2018 <a target="_blank" href="https://www.elespanol.com/economia/medios/20180411/ojd-certifica-historico-espanol-millones-usuarios-unicos/298971110_0.html">El Español reached the 32,5 million unique users monthly</a>, went to the top 10 most used news sources in the country and quickly became one of the most trusted sources of information.</p>

				<h2 class="bolder">Design</h2>
				<p>In the past, a lot of printed Newspapers were designed by journalists to reduce expenses. While on the surface this might seem a natural way to operate, for many obvious reasons media companies became more competitive when they started to take advantages from well designed experiences and quick product deliveries if they hire designers, engineers, marketeers, and so on …</p>
				<P>El Español, as a native media company has a lot in common with other organizations but what really makes the difference is their way of thinking. The user centered Design, the unique user experiences across devices, being mobile first or even building responsive layouts, were definitely the right keys to successfully compete against bigger organisations.</P>
				<div class="holding-1--full">
					<img src="assets/images/ee/wireframe.gif" alt="">
				</div>
				<p>The major point about building El Español or about building products in house is, that it’s critical to build something that users will love in the future, so the design process is organised like this:</p>

							<li>
								<span><strong>1 - Idea / briefing</strong></span>
								<p>It’s a document that outlines the main concept of the project, it’s functionality and the goals to be achieved</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<span><strong>2 - Research</strong></span>
								<p>Crucial to define the viability of the idea and to measure the how sustainable it is</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<span><strong>3 - Wireframing</strong></span>
								<p>The lo-fi prototyping first. Positioning the main idea with the elements side by side with some high level of usability, the user experience is going to shine here</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<span><strong>4 - Ux testing</strong></span>
								<p>Testing it on personas and on potential users. it allows changing inefficient solutions and it helps designers to evaluate the good and the bad decisions</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<span><strong>5 - User interface design</strong></span>
								<p>Interfaces exist to be used! At this stage we make sure the environment we create fits user needs</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<span><strong>6 - Validation</strong></span>
								<p>This is where design and technology meet again and we make sure it all works on any device, browser and on any resolution</p>
							</li>
						</ol>

				<h2 class="bolder">Problem identification</h2>
				<p>There are no restraints to any who wants to see El Español’s contents. Anyone with an internet connection can do it at any time. The target is the users between the age group of 18 to 70 of both genders.</p>
				<p>The reasons why people are choosing El Español as their main source of information are diverse. Moving from other sources to a subscription model news page means the user really wants to be informed and it pays for a high quality filter that guarantees access only to the best content. Design is the trust, the identity, the interface but essentially it is the experience that will make the user enjoy every moment or it will make him come back later. Design is the front door and it has a lot to do here.</p>

				<h2 class="bolder">Tools</h2>
				<p>After joining El Español I gathered the courage to attempt always better tools for working. For that reason most of my research as a Designer evolves finding the best tools to improve my workflow. <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/">Sketch</a> is the main tool I use for lo-fi and recently hi-fi prototyping. It allows me to expand its functionalities by using plugins and it is extremely fast, cheap and easy to use. Interactions and experiences are made on <a href="origami.html">Origami Studio</a> and for less complex projects I use <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">Invision</a>.</br>GIT, HTML and SASS are part of my daily tools too.</p>
