								| Polychromeer is a design studio I founded in 2022 to offer a leaner alternative to traditional agencies. After over a decade in the industry, I realized that companies often struggle with bloated processes, endless meetings and "design by committee."
								br
								br
								| The mission is to help companies build without complication. Polychromeer provides direct access to senior design expertise, stripping away the layers of management to deliver high-quality digital products with speed and precision.

						h2.font__small-2 The Philosophy
					.box__body
						p.font__small-1
							| The Problem with Traditional Agencies
							br
							br
							| Many startups and SMEs need enterprise-grade design but can't afford the sluggish pace of big firms. They face:
							br
							br
							| .1 - Simple requests turning into month-long projects
							br
							br
							| .2 - The people selling the work aren't the ones doing the work
							br
							br
							| .3 - Fragmented brand experiences across web and product
							br
							br
							| Polychromeer was built on the principle of "Radical Simplicity." The studio is not just a service provider, but a "plug-and-play" product partner. The workflow is designed to be asynchronous, transparent and focused entirely on shipping.

						h2.font__small-2 Services & Capabilities
					.box__body
						p.font__small-1
							| I utilized my background in Design Systems and Product Strategy to offer a curated suite of services:
							br
							br
							| .1 - Product Design (UX/UI): End-to-end design for SaaS and mobile apps.
							br
							br
							| .2 - Design Systems: Setting up scalable foundations for growing teams (Figma tokenization, component libraries).
							br
							br
							| .3 - Web Architecture: Building performant, responsive marketing sites that convert.

						h2.font__small-2 Brand & Visual Identity
					.box__body
						p.font__small-1
							| To practice what I preach, the Polychromeer brand itself had to be a masterclass in clarity.
							br
							br
							| I chose a clean, bold aesthetic that emphasizes structure over decoration. The site uses high-contrast typography and ample whitespace to communicate confidence.
							br
							br
							| The Name: "Polychromeer" reflects the spectrum of capabilities—bringing color and life to technical, monochromatic business problems.
