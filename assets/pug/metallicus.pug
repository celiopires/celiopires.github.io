							.box__body
								p.font__small-1
									| Metallicus is a fintech powerhouse building a fully integrated ecosystem of digital asset products. Unlike isolated crypto apps, Metallicus bridges the gap between traditional banking (Fiat) and decentralized finance (DeFi) through a Layer 0 blockchain and a suite of consumer applications.
									br
									br
									| I oversaw the design of 8+ interconnected products, including MetalPay (Consumer Crypto Wallet), Proton Dex (Professional Trading), WebAuth (Identity Wallet) and Proton Loan (DeFi Lending).
									br
									br
									| To make Web3 accessible, compliant and safe for the mass market while providing powerful tools for crypto-natives.

								h2.font__small-2 My Role & Evolution
							.box__body
								p.font__small-1
									| Started by executing hands-on UI/UX for the core wallet experience, then took ownership of product design strategy and established the first design system.
									br
									br
									| Built and led the design team. Responsible for the holistic user experience across the entire ecosystem, Design Operations (DesignOps) and unifying the visual language across 8+ distinct products.

							h2.font__small-2 The Challenge (UX Analysis)
						.box__body
							p.font__small-1
								| We had 8+ products (Consumer vs. Pro / Web vs. Mobile). Without a strong system, they risked looking like 8 different companies.
								br
								br
								| Web3 is inherently complex (keys, gas fees) and Metallicus is heavily regulated (KYC/AML). The UX had to hide the blockchain complexity while highlighting the compliance safety.
								br
								br
								| To encourage mass adoption, the interface couldn't look like a cyberpunk tool. It needed the polish and reliability of a neobank (like Revolut or N26) combined with the power of DeFi.
								br
								br
								| The goal was to "Facilitate Web3 adoption by removing the friction of fear.

							h2.font__small-2 The Solution
						.box__body
							p.font__small-1
								| Instead of forcing one visual style on everyone, created a Unified Core System that allowed for distinct personalities:
								br
								br
								| - MetalPay: Designed for the Consumer. Friendly, colorful, rounded, and simple. Focused on "fun" and social payments.
								br
								br
								| - Proton Dex/Loan: Designed for the Trader. Dark modes, high data density, technical charts and precision. Focused on speed and information.
								br
								br
								| Key UX Wins:
								br
								| .1 - Human-Readable Identity: We replaced complex wallet addresses (0x7e2...) with simple @names (e.g., @celio), making the ecosystem feel social and safe.
								br
								br
								| .2 - Identity (WebAuth): Designed a seamless SSO (Single Sign-On) experience where one digital identity allows access to every product in the ecosystem.

							h2.font__small-2 Design Process & Management
						.box__body
							p.font__small-1
								| As Lead Designer, my brain had to shift constantly from pixels to people and processes.
								br
								br
								| .1 - Discovery & Research: I led the team in mapping user personas, differentiating between the "Crypto Curious" (MetalPay users) and the "DeFi Degens" (Proton users) to tailor interfaces for each.
								br
								br
								| .2 - Design Ops: I established the workflows that allowed us to adhere to ambitious timelines. This included weekly design crits, developer hand-off protocols and unified tooling (Figma).
								br
								br
								| .3 - Strategy: Worked directly with the C-Suite to define how new products (like Proton Loan) would fit into the existing navigation and ecosystem without causing bloat.

							h2.font__small-2 Main Features (The Ecosystem)
						.box__body
							p.font__small-1
								| MetalPay (Mobile App):
								br
								| - Feature: Recurring Buys. A "Set and Forget" flow allowing users to automate investment.
								br
								| - Feature: Social Payments. Sending crypto to friends as easily as sending a text message.
								br
								br
								| Proton Dex (Web App):
								br
								| - Feature: Professional Trading Interface. A high-density dashboard featuring real-time Order Books, Depth Charts, and Trading History.
								br
								br
								| WebAuth (Identity):
								br
								| - Feature: Biometric Signing. Replacing password fatigue with FaceID/TouchID for blockchain transactions.

							h2.font__small-2 Ecosystem Architecture
						.box__body
							p.font__small-1
								| The architecture is built on a Hub and Spoke model:
								br
								br
								| The Hub (WebAuth): The user's Identity and Private Keys. This is the passport to the ecosystem.
								br
								br
								| The Spokes (The Apps):
								br
								| MetalPay: The Fiat On-Ramp (Bank $ → Crypto).
								br
								| Proton Swap/Dex: The Exchange (Crypto → Crypto).
								br
								| Proton Loan: The Bank (Lending/Borrowing).

								| Managing 8+ Products with One Core
								br
								br
								| To manage this scale, I oversaw the creation of a Multi-Brand Design System.
								br
								br
								| The "Core" Library: A shared repository of functional atoms (Inputs, Buttons, Toggles, Modals) that ensured interaction consistency. If you knew how to use MetalPay, you intuitively knew how to use Proton Loan.
								br
								br
								| The "Theme" Layer:
								br
								| Metal Brand: Vibrant gradients, soft shadows, rounded typography (Circular/Geometric).
								br
								| Proton Brand: Technical aesthetic, deep purples/blacks, monospaced data fonts, sharp edges.
								br
								br
								| Component scalability: We designed components to be "responsive by default" to handle the transition from complex desktop trading views to mobile wallet views.

							h2.font__small-2 Conclusion & Impact
						.box__body
							p.font__small-1
								| Metallicus was a masterclass in complexity management.
								br
								br
								| We successfully launched and maintained 8+ products using a unified design team and system. We helped transition users from traditional banking to Web3 by hiding the technology behind a beautiful, compliant interface.
								br
								br
								| I left behind a mature design culture and a robust design system that allows the company to continue shipping features at speed.
