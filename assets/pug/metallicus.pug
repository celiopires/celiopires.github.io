								| My mission as a Designer and as a Lead Product Designer was to continuously improve the user experience to facilitate the web3 adoption.
								| If users can easily understand how a product works, they're more likely to use it and embrace its benefits.
								br
								br
								| Product design is important for web3 because it's essential that products look good and function properly.
								| Poor product design can lead to users feeling frustrated or confused. 
								| This can damage user trust in a product, and it can also deter people from using it.
