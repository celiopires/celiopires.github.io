							.box__body
								p.font__small-1
									| Sphera is an AI-powered intelligence platform designed for online retailers. It aggregates fragmented data from marketing channels (Meta, Google, TikTok) and store performance (Shopify, Magento) to provide a unified view of ROI.
									br
									br
									| The Goal: To move ecommerce managers from "Analysis Paralysis" to "Actionable Strategy." By rebranding and redesigning the platform from the ground up, we aimed to democratize access to advanced data science, allowing non-technical merchants to optimize campaigns with a single click.

							h2.font__small-2 The Challenge (UX Analysis)
						.box__body
							p.font__small-1
								| The original platform (SQDL) was powerful but technically overwhelming. Users were facing three core problems:
								| Data Overload: Merchants were drowning in spreadsheets and raw numbers without understanding the story behind them.
								br
								br
								| The "Black Box" Problem: Users didn't trust the AI recommendations because the interface didn't explain why a suggestion was made (e.g., "Why should I increase budget here?").
								br
								br
								| Fragmented Workflows: Users had to switch between the platform and their ad managers to make changes.
								br
								br
								| The User Pain Point: "I know I'm wasting money on ads, but I don't know which ones to turn off."
					.paragraph__box--1col
						.box__header-small
							h2.font__small-2 The Solution
						.box__body
							p.font__small-1
								| Instead of just showing graphs, the interface focuses on Insights & Actions. We introduced "Explainable AI" patterns—UI elements that break down the logic behind a prediction in plain English, to build user trust.
								br
								br
								| The "Overview" Dashboard: A prioritized feed of anomalies (e.g., "Ad spend spiked but sales didn't") rather than a generic wall of charts.
								br
								br
								| Integrated write-access APIs so users can accept an AI recommendation (e.g., "Pause Campaign") directly within Sphera, closing the loop.

					//- 			| From Abstract to Concrete
					//- 			br
					//- 			br
					//- 			| Phase 1: Rebranding & Strategy
					//- 			br
					//- 			| Naming Transition: Managed the visual transition from SQDL (technical, acronym-heavy) to Sphera (holistic, global, encompassing).
					//- 			br
					//- 			br
					//- 			| Visual Identity: Moved away from "developer dark mode" to a clean, light, and trustworthy aesthetic suitable for financial decisions.
					//- 			br
					//- 			br
					//- 			| Phase 2: Information Architecture & Data Viz
					//- 			br
					//- 			| Metric Hierarchy: We categorized metrics into Primary (Revenue, ROAS) and Secondary (CTR, CPM) to prevent visual noise.
					//- 			br
					//- 			br
					//- 			| Chart Library: I designed a custom charting system. We had to solve the challenge of displaying time-series data (performance over time) overlaid with discrete events (marketing changes).
					//- 			br
					//- 			br
					//- 			| Phase 3: Wireframing & Prototyping
					//- 			br
					//- 			| Focused heavily on the "Insight Card" layout—how to present a problem, a cause, and a solution in a small UI component.
					//- 			br
					//- 			br
					//- 			| Tested "Confidence Scores" (e.g., "We are 85% sure this will improve ROI") to see if it increased user adoption of AI suggestions.
					//- 			br
					//- 			br
					//- 			| Phase 4: High Fidelity & Design System
					//- 			br
					//- 			| Built a rigorous system for the dashboard, specifically focusing on table design (sorting, filtering, bulk actions) which is the bread and butter of enterprise tools.

								| Color Palette:
								br
								| - Trustworthy Neutrals: Heavy use of whitespace and cool grays to let the data breathe (The platform was also dark-mode ready).
								br
								br
								| - Created a categorical color palette ensuring that charts with 5+ variables remained distinct and color-blind accessible.
								br
								br
								| - Soft Red (Negative trend) vs. Mint Green (Positive trend) used sparingly to draw attention.
								br
								br
								| Typography:
								br
								| - Used tabular lining figures (monospaced numbers) within [Insert Font, e.g., Inter or Roboto Mono] to ensure financial data aligned perfectly in vertical columns.
								br
								br
								| - "Insight Cards," Data Tables with sticky headers and interactive Line/Bar charts using a customized chart library.
