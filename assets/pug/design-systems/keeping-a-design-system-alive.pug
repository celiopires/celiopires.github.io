								| Most design systems die after the first release. Everyone's excited for two weeks and then the product grows and the system stays still.
								br
								br
								| Components get outdated. Patterns drift. New features don't use the system. Teams start building their own versions again. The system becomes a museum piece instead of a working tool.
								br
								br
								| To avoid that I added simple maintenance loops: monthly reviews, new component proposals, cleaning duplicates, quick audits.

								h2.font__small-2 Maintenance loops
							.box__body
								p.font__small-1
									| Simple routines that kept the system relevant:
									br
									br
									| • monthly reviews
									br
									| • new component proposals
									br
									| • cleaning duplicates
									br
									| • quick audits
									br
									br
									| Nothing fancy. Just consistent care. These small, regular check-ins prevented the system from drifting and kept it aligned with how the product actually evolved.
						.paragraph_box--2
							.box__header-small
								h2.font__small-2 Examples
							.box__body
								p.font__small-1
									| Different products needed different focus:
									br
									br
									| • At 
									a(href='/bitloops.html') Bitloops
									|  this meant syncing design and code often
									br
									| • At 
									a(href='/sphera.html') Sphera
									|  it meant checking that patterns still matched new dashboards
									br
									| • At 
									a(href='/commons.html') Commons
									|  it meant updating flows as rules changed
									br
									br
									| Each product had unique needs, but the principle was the same: keep the system in sync with reality.

					.paragraph__box--2col

								h2.font__small-2 Tools
							.box__body
								p.font__small-1
									| The right tools made maintenance easier:
									br
									br
									| • Figma branches helped with safe updates
									br
									| • Jira kept track of changes
									br
									| • Loom updates made communication easy
									br
									| • A shared changelog kept everyone aligned
									br
									br
									| These tools weren't fancy, but they made it easy to maintain the system without chaos. Updates were safe, changes were tracked, communication was clear.
						.paragraph_box--2

								h2.font__small-2 Communication
							.box__body
								p.font__small-1
									| Keeping everyone informed was key:
									br
									br
									| • Loom updates made communication easy
									br
									| • A shared changelog kept everyone aligned
									br
									| • Regular reviews meant teams knew what was changing
									br
									| • Clear documentation prevented confusion
									br
									br
									| When people know what's happening, they trust the system. When they trust it, they use it. When they use it, it stays alive.

						.box__body
							p.font__small-1
								| A system is a small product living inside the big one. If you look after it it stays useful. If you ignore it it disappears.
								br
								br
								| Most design systems die after the first release because nobody takes care of them. The product grows, the system doesn't, and teams drift away.
								br
								br
								| Simple maintenance loops prevent that. Monthly reviews, cleaning duplicates, syncing with code, updating patterns. Nothing fancy. Just consistent care.
								br
								br
								| When you treat the system like a product — with regular updates, clear communication, and ongoing attention — it stays alive. It becomes part of how teams work instead of something they work around.
