							h2.font__small-2 Why adoption matters
						.box__body
							p.font__small-1
								| Without adoption:
								br
								br
								| • teams build their own versions
								br
								| • logic shifts from squad to squad
								br
								| • engineers patch things on the fly
								br
								| • reviews drag on
								br
								| • design debt piles up
								br
								br
								| A system only works if people use it. Otherwise it's just a Figma file.

							h2.font__small-2 My role
						.box__body
							p.font__small-1
								| I didn't just build components. I made teams understand why the system mattered, how to use it, and how to keep it alive. Half my time was talking, half was designing.
					.paragraph__box--1col
						.box__header-small
							h2.font__small-2 How I made it stick
						.box__body
							p.font__small-1
								| Getting teams to actually use the system required a mix of strategy, communication, and persistence.
					.paragraph__box--1col
						.box__header-small
							h2.font__small-2 Getting buy-in
						.box__body
							p.font__small-1
								| Show the cost of chaos: slow delivery, mismatched UI, more bugs. People adopt when they see the pain.
					.paragraph__box--1col
						.box__header-small
							h2.font__small-2 Engineering alignment
						.box__body
							p.font__small-1
								| Loop in developers early, agree on naming and logic. Even without Storybook, the system mapped cleanly to code.
					.paragraph__box--1col
						.box__header-small
							h2.font__small-2 Rollout
						.box__body
							p.font__small-1
								| Small teams: library + guide. Large teams: training, migration plan, feedback loop.
					.paragraph__box--1col
						.box__header-small
							h2.font__small-2 Handling resistance
						.box__body
							p.font__small-1
								| "This doesn't fit my flow?" I reviewed, adjusted, or explained trade-offs. Most pushback is clarity, not intent.
					.paragraph__box--1col
						.box__header-small
							h2.font__small-2 Keeping it alive
						.box__body
							p.font__small-1
								| Review new components, clean duplicates, audit usage, refactor when the product shifts. Simple, consistent care.
					.paragraph__box--1col
						.box__header-small
							h2.font__small-2 Impact
						.box__body
							p.font__small-1
								| Teams shipped faster, UI mismatches dropped, less rework, cleaner code, happier designers and engineers.
								br
								br
								| Sometimes bug counts went down.
								br
								br
								| Sometimes the same buttons stopped being rebuilt three times a week.
								br
								br
								| Sometimes both.
					.paragraph__box--1col
						.box__header-small
							h2.font__small-2 What I learned
						.box__body
							p.font__small-1
								| A design system isn't just components.
								br
								br
								| It's alignment, trust, and adoption.
								br
								br
								| The structure matters, but adoption is what makes a system real.
