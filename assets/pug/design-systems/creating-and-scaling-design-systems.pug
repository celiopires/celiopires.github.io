						| I've worked on a bunch of products over the years and most of them had the same issue. As teams grew the UI started to drift. One team shipped something new, another team updated an old screen, someone copied an old button from a file from 2019… you know how it goes. A design system became the only way to keep things clean and predictable.

							h2.font__small-2 Why the system was needed
						.box__body
							p.font__small-1
								| Across projects like El Español, Telefónica, Commons or Metallicus the patterns were always the same:
								br
								br
								| • components duplicated in random places
								br
								| • design choices changing from team to team
								br
								| • engineers rebuilding the same UI again and again
								br
								| • reviews taking forever because nothing matched
								br
								| • design debt piling up quietly
								br
								br
								| So the system wasn't just a "nice tool". It was the thing that stopped the chaos.
					.paragraph__box--1col
						.box__header-small
							h2.font__small-2 My role
						.box__body
							p.font__small-1
								| I usually took the lead on defining the structure, building the core components, getting teams aligned, making sure the system didn't die after two months.
								br
								br
								| Honestly half of the job was communication. The other half was Figma.

					.paragraph__box--1col
						.box__header-small
							h2.font__small-2 How I structured the system
						.box__body
							p.font__small-1
								| The approach changed a bit depending on the product size but the base looked like this.
	
					//- Example 1 - Tokens and foundations			
					.paragraph__box--2col
						.paragraph_box--1
							.box__header-small
								h2.font__small-2 1. Tokens and foundations
							.box__body
								p.font__small-1
									| I always started with the basics. Design System principles, spacing, colours, typography, grids, borders.
									br
									br
									| Then the accessibility part came in right away because it’s not something you “add later”. Contrast ratios that actually pass, font sizes that don’t force people to zoom, line heights that stay readable, touch targets that meet standards.
									br
									br
									| If these weren't stable nothing else would work.

							.box__body
								p.font__small-1
									| Buttons, inputs, dropdowns, cards, navigation.
									br
									br
									| Clean naming, predictable logic and variants that matched real use cases instead of imaginary ones.
									| On 
									a(href="/elespanol.html") El Español
									|  I even pushed for a BEM-style naming convention which helped designers and engineers speak the same language. It kept components consistent and made the whole system easier to scale across teams fast workflow.

								h2.font__small-2 3. Patterns
							.box__body
								p.font__small-1
									| For bigger products like Telefónica or Metallicus I added patterns on top.
									br
									br
									| Forms, filters, tables, dashboards.
									br
									br
									| These were the pieces teams used every day so getting them right saved a lot of headaches. I also made sure the patterns weren’t just pretty but actually worked with real data, edge cases and weird states that only show up in production. This is the level where teams start saving time.

								h2.font__small-2 4. Documentation
							.box__body
							p.font__small-1
								| For teams like Metallicus and Commons I worked closely with developers to map Figma structure into their world.
								br
								br
								| Even when the company didn't use Storybook the goal was the same: predictable components that engineers could rely on.

							.box__body
								p.font__small-1
									| Every component came with clear usage notes.
									br
									br
									| When to use it, when not to use it, behaviour rules, accessibility basics.
									br
									br
									| Some of the most commons tools to keep the documentation updated were:
									br
									| • Figma (for 
									a(href='/bitloops.html') Bitloops
									| , 
									a(href='/commons.html') Commons
									| , 
									a(href='/sphera.html') Sphera
									| )
									br
									| • Zepelin Docs (for 
									a(href='/telefonica.html') Telefónica
									| )
									br
									| • Confluence (for Talkdesk)
									br
									| • Sketch Cloud (for 
									a(href='/elespanol.html') El Español

								| Once the first version existed the real work began. Different products needed different plans.
								br
								br
								| • For smaller teams a simple library and a short guide was enough
								br
								| • For bigger ones I created a migration plan, support sessions, deprecation process and a feedback loop

							h2.font__small-2 Getting buy-in
						.box__body
							p.font__small-1
								| I showed teams before and after implementing the system how much pain it removed:
								br
								br
								| • fewer inconsistencies
								br
								| • faster development
								br
								| • shared vocabulary
								br
								| • easier onboarding
								br
								| • fewer UI bugs
								br
								br
								| Once people realised it actually made their life easier adoption happened on its own.

						.box__body
							p.font__small-1
								| A design system dies fast if nobody takes care of it.
								br
								br
								| So I added a small routine of reviews:
								br
								br
								| • check new components
								br
								| • audit the library
								br
								| • clean duplicates
								br
								| • refactor when the product changed
								br
								br
								| Nothing fancy. Just consistent care.

								| Without showing any private UI here's the type of work I did:
								br
								br
								| • 
								a(href="/elespanol.html") El Español
								| : foundations and reusable pieces for a fast newsroom workflow
								br
								| • 
								a(href="/telefonica.html") Telefónica
								| : scaled the system across multiple products and teams
								br
								| • 
								a(href="/clutch.html") Clutch
								| : built tokens, core components and the early documentation
								br
								| • 
								a(href="/metallicus.html") Metallicus
								| : created patterns for complex admin flows and aligned design and engineering so components behaved the same in Figma and in code
								br
								| • 
								a(href="/bitloops.html") Bitloops
								| : helped structure a system that supported a product with heavy engineering needs
								br
								| • 
								a(href="/sphera.html") Sphera
								| : cleaned patterns and unified behaviours across different parts of the platform
					.paragraph__box--1col
						.box__header-small
							h2.font__small-2 Impact
						.box__body
							p.font__small-1
								| The results were pretty consistent:
								br
								br
								| • faster feature development
								br
								| • fewer inconsistencies
								br
								| • fewer redesigns
								br
								| • less engineering time wasted
								br
								| • predictable UI
								br
								| • smoother onboarding
								br
								br
								| Sometimes the number of UI bugs dropped.
								br
								br
								| Sometimes designers stopped recreating the same stuff every week.
								br
								br
								| Sometimes both.

							h2.font__small-2 What I learned
						.box__body
							p.font__small-1
								| A design system is not just components.
								br
								br
								| It's alignment. It's clarity. It's teams agreeing on what "good" looks like.
								br
								br
								| The structure matters but adoption matters more.
								br
								br
								| If people trust the system everything else is easier: design, code, decisions, releases.
