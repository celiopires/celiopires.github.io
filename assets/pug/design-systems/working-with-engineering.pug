								h2.font__small-2 Mapping Figma to code
							.box__body
								p.font__small-1
									| I usually started by sitting with the engineering leads to map how Figma should behave in code.
									br
									br
									| We aligned on:
									br
									| • naming conventions
									br
									| • component states
									br
									| • constraints and layouts
									br
									| • variant structures
									br
									br
									| Nothing glamorous, just clarity. This upfront work meant components translated cleanly from design to code without confusion or rework.

								h2.font__small-2 Component specs
							.box__body
								p.font__small-1
									| Even when teams didn't use Storybook we still made predictable component specs.
									br
									br
									| Every component came with:
									br
									| • clear usage guidelines
									br
									| • behavior rules
									br
									| • edge cases and states
									br
									| • accessibility requirements
									br
									br
									| The goal was always the same: engineers could rely on the specs to build without guessing.

					//- Documentation and Process

								h2.font__small-2 Documentation
							.box__body
								p.font__small-1
									| Zeroheight helped with documentation and Jira kept things tidy.
									br
									br
									| Documentation wasn't just about showing components. It was about making sure engineers knew when to use what, how components behaved, and what to do when something didn't fit.
									br
									br
									| Clear docs meant fewer questions, faster implementation, and less back-and-forth.
						.paragraph_box--2
							.box__header-small
								h2.font__small-2 Process
							.box__body
								p.font__small-1
									| Jira kept things organized and tracked.
									br
									br
									| We used it to:
									br
									| • track component requests
									br
									| • manage updates and changes
									br
									| • document decisions
									br
									| • keep everyone aligned
									br
									br
									| Simple, but it kept the system moving forward without chaos.

							h2.font__small-2 Trust and collaboration
						.box__body
							p.font__small-1
								| Engineers always had space to challenge decisions. If something felt heavy or confusing we fixed it together. That's how trust builds.
								br
								br
								| When an engineer said "this doesn't make sense" or "this is too complex" I listened. Sometimes the design needed to change. Sometimes we needed a different approach. The system wasn't just my vision — it was ours.
								br
								br
								| And when engineers trust the system it becomes part of their workflow instead of something they avoid. They start suggesting improvements. They become advocates. They help keep it alive.

							h2.font__small-2 What I learned
						.box__body
							p.font__small-1
								| Design systems only work when design and engineering move in the same direction.
								br
								br
								| Early alignment saves everyone time. Clear specs prevent confusion. Trust makes the system real.
								br
								br
								| When engineers trust the system, everything else is easier: implementation, maintenance, evolution. The system becomes part of how the team works, not something they work around.
