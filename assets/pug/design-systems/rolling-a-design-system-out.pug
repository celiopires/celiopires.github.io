								| On smaller projects like

								|  a clean Figma library and a short guide was enough.

								| , 
								a(href='/sphera.html') Sphera
								|  or 
								a(href='/commons.html') Commons
								|  I needed an actual plan.

									| On smaller projects like 
									a(href='/clutch.html') Clutch
									|  a clean Figma library and a short guide was enough.
									br
									br
									| The team was small, the product was focused, and adoption happened naturally. A well-organized library and clear usage guidelines were all that was needed to get everyone on the same page.

									| Multiple teams, complex products, and existing patterns meant the rollout needed structure: clear documentation, training sessions, migration tracking, and support.

									br
									br
									| Documentation wasn't just a list of components. It included:
									br
									| • clear usage guidelines
									br
									| • "when to use it" and "when not to"
									br
									| • quick video tutorials
									br
									| • behavior rules and edge cases
									br
									br
									| When people know exactly how to start they adopt the system without you pushing it.

							.box__body
								p.font__small-1
									| Then short training sessions so people knew how to migrate screens without breaking flows.
									br
									br
									| These sessions covered:
									br
									| • how to use the library
									br
									| • migration strategies
									br
									| • common pitfalls to avoid
									br
									| • how to maintain existing flows
									br
									br
									| Hands-on training meant teams could start using the system immediately without breaking what already worked.

						.box__body
							p.font__small-1
								| For large migrations everything lived in Jira — what was updated, what was pending and what needed review. It kept the rollout controlled instead of chaotic.
								br
								br
								| Jira tracked:
								br
								| • what screens were updated
								br
								| • what was still pending
								br
								| • what needed review
								br
								| • blockers and dependencies
								br
								br
								| This visibility kept everyone aligned and the rollout moving forward without chaos. Teams knew what to work on, what was done, and what was next.

								| Rolling out a system is never "drop the library and pray".
								br
								br
								| Each product needed something different. Smaller teams needed simplicity. Bigger teams needed structure. Clear documentation, training, and tracking made the difference between adoption and abandonment.
								br
								br
								| When people know exactly how to start they adopt the system without you pushing it. The rollout becomes a natural part of their workflow instead of an extra burden.
