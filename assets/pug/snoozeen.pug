						.box__body
							p.font__small-1
								| Snoozeen was designed as a digital-first accounting and company formation platform tailored specifically for the Portuguese market. It aimed to be the operating system for freelancers and startups, replacing archaic paper processes with a streamlined SaaS interface.
								br
								br
								| The Problem: Opening and managing a business in Portugal is notoriously bureaucratic, slow, and opaque. The Goal: To offer a "Business on Auto-Pilot" experience. From incorporating a company in under 48 hours to automating tax declarations, Snoozeen combined modern software with certified accountancy to handle the heavy lifting.

						h2.font__small-2 The Challenge (UX Analysis)
					.box__body
						p.font__small-1
							| The "Paperwork" Barrier
							br
							br
							| The Portuguese market suffers from a massive disconnect between modern digital entrepreneurs and legacy government systems.
							br
							br
							| .1 - Startups struggle to navigate VAT rules, Social Security, and quarterly reports
							br
							br
							| .2 - Users never know "where" their documents are in the approval chain
							br
							br
							| .3 - Entrepreneurs usually need separate tools for invoicing, expense tracking, and communicating with their accountant
							br
							br
							| The User Pain Point: "I want to focus on my product, not on deciphering tax codes or driving to government offices."

						h2.font__small-2 The Solution
					.box__body
						p.font__small-1
							| Strategic Approach
							br
							br
							| I designed Snoozeen as a Service-as-a-Software (SaaS) wrapper around traditional accounting.
							br
							br
							| The strategy was "100% Online, 100% Transparency."
							br
							br
							| I designed flows to promise initial documentation in <48 hours, compared to the industry standard of weeks.
							br
							br
							| Unlike traditional legacy accountants, Snoozeen was designed to support the modern economy, including Cryptocurrency assets, Multi-currency invoicing (USD/EUR) and digital nomad lifestyles.

						h2.font__small-2 Design Strategy & Process
					.box__body
						p.font__small-1
							strong Phase 1: The "Service" Design
							br
							br
							| Pricing Transparency: I designed a "Fixed Rate" pricing model (Annual Plans) to eliminate the fear of hourly billing. The UI clearly differentiated between "Individual Business" and "General Partnerships" to guide users to the right legal structure.
							br
							br
							| The "Waitlist" Strategy: Designed a pre-launch landing page focused on "Early Adopter" gamification (Badges, Lifetime discounts) to validate demand before building the backend.
							br
							br
							strong Phase 2: The Dashboard (The Product)
							br
							br
							| The dashboard was designed to answer three questions immediately:
							br
							br
							| - How much money have I made? (Invoicing)
							br
							| - What do I owe? (Tax Estimation)
							br
							| Is my paperwork done? (Compliance Status)

						h2.font__small-2 Materials Used (UI & Branding)
					.box__body
						p.font__small-1
							| Brand Identity: The name "Snoozeen" (Snooze + Zen) dictated the aesthetic.
							br
							br
							| Color Palette: Calming teals and trustworthy deep blues. Avoided the "aggressive red" often used in finance to reduce anxiety.
							br
							br
							| Typography: Clean, sans-serif fonts to make dense legal text readable.

					.box__body
						p.font__small-1
							| Snoozeen represents a deep dive into Fintech UX and Service Design. While the project faced regulatory bureaucracy that stalled its launch, it proved that there is a massive appetite for user-centric financial tools in Southern Europe. It demonstrated my ability to translate complex legal requirements into simple, beautiful user flows.
