							| In the technology-driven year of 2014-2015, a lot of News pages did not keep up with the technology revolution. Their visuals had been the same for years and, in addition, they had not adapted their expertise to the new smart gadgets. Disruptive digital merchandise were required to operate on any device, at any time, in order to accomplish a great human-machine interaction.

								| The project prioritised mobility and flexibility, which were at the core of every decision. It was aimed at being accessible to young or old people, and being mobile-first, fully responsive, and accessible to all users. The choice of a priori premises reflected the project's initial ambitions.

								| Methodologies like Desk research and Benchmarking were being constantly used to research the market and the competitors. Finding the right UI elements and the UX is a crucial step to counterbalance Observador’s editorial position. Opinion pages were designed with those methods in mind, they contain important issues written with the right balance of fact, analysis and a touch of irony or humor sometimes.

								| At Observador both professionals were always working side by side and sharing knowledge. I had the opportunity to do code and developers were always helping with the design decisions and user experience. We were a really small team at that time and in my case thinking in CSS while doing my designs helped me a lot with limitations and constraints.
