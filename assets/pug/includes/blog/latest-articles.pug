									.font__small-1 Driving Adoption in Design Systems
									.font__small-2 Building a design system is one thing. Getting people to actually use it is another. Across projects like El Español, Telefónica, Commons, and Metallicus I saw the same pattern: great components, zero adoption, and chaos creeping back in.

									.font__small-1 Creating and Scaling Design Systems
									.font__small-2 I've worked on a bunch of products over the years and most of them had the same issue. As teams grew the UI started to drift. One team shipped something new, another team updated an old screen, someone copied an old button from a file from 2019… you know how it goes. A design system became the only way to keep things clean and predictable.

									.font__small-1 Working with Engineers
									.font__small-2 Design systems only work when design and engineering move in the same direction. On projects like Bitloops, Clutch and Metallicus I learned that early alignment saves everyone time.

									.font__small-1 Rolling a Design System out
									.font__small-2 Rolling out a system is never "drop the library and pray". Each product needed something different.

									.font__small-1 Handling Resistance
									.font__small-2 There's always a moment where someone says "this component doesn't fit my team's flow." Most resistance is not about the component. It's about trust.

									.font__small-1 Keeping a Design System alive
									.font__small-2 Most design systems die after the first release. Everyone's excited for two weeks and then the product grows and the system stays still. Nothing fancy. Just consistent care.
