					.box__body
						p.font__small-1
							| El Español is a 100% digital media outlet that disrupted the Spanish news market. As a native digital product, our competitive advantage against legacy newspapers relied entirely on user experience: speed, mobile-first responsiveness, and a premium reading interface.

						h2.font__small-2 My Role: Hybrid Product Designer
					.box__body
						p.font__small-1
							| I operated as a true "Hybrid Designer," bridging the gap between the creative team and engineering. I didn't just hand off mockups; I integrated directly into the development workflow, writing code and managing repositories.

						h2.font__small-2 The Challenge: Scaling Without Resources
					.box__body
						p.font__small-1
							| In 2015, the design team was too small to handle the volume of daily news requests. We faced a bottleneck:
						p.font__small-1
							| - We were rebuilding the same UI elements (buttons, cards, headers) repeatedly.
						p.font__small-1
							| - Without a shared language, the "mobile-first" experience was fragmenting across devices.
						p.font__small-1
							| - The news cycle is instant. We needed a workflow that allowed us to ship features in minutes, not days.

				.paragraph__box--1col
					.box__header-small
						h2.font__small-2 The Solution
					.box__body
						p.font__small-1
							| - I identified that most design requests were actually variations of existing patterns. This insight launched the company's first Design System.
						p.font__small-1
							| - 1. The Audit & Documentation I led the initiative to collect, standardize, and document all UI elements. We moved from designing unique pages to assembling pages from approved components.
						p.font__small-1
							| - 2. Architecture as Code (SASS) This is where I went beyond traditional design. I architected the SASS file structure to match the visual Information Architecture.
						p.font__small-1
							| - I wrote and managed the CSS/SASS code to ensure that the "Design System" wasn't just a Sketch file—it was live production code.
						p.font__small-1
							| - I worked side-by-side with frontend engineers in Git, ensuring the bridge between design intent and browser rendering was flawless.

						h2.font__small-2 UX Strategy: Lean & Data-Driven
					.box__body
						p.font__small-1
							| We implemented a Lean UX process to validate ideas quickly.
						p.font__small-1
							| Collaborative Loops: Worked directly with SEO experts and Data Analysts to base design decisions on real traffic metrics.
						p.font__small-1
							| Rapid Prototyping: Used Sketch for high-fidelity UI and Origami Studio for complex interaction flows to test concepts before writing a single line of code.

						h2.font__small-2 Impact
					.box__body
						p.font__small-1
							| - Drastically reduced "pixel-pushing" time, allowing the team to focus on feature strategy.
						p.font__small-1
							| - Established a single source of truth that lived in both the design tools and the codebase.
						p.font__small-1
							| - Built the infrastructure that allowed El Español to scale into one of the most read digital newspapers in Spain.
