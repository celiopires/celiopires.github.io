						p.font__small-1
							| Telefónica is one of the world's largest telecommunications providers. I worked within the Tuenti mobile team, implementing an ambitious strategy to unify the product experience. The goal was to develop and execute a robust Design System that could ensure consistency across Telefónica's multi-brand ecosystem, serving millions of users.

					.box__body
						p.font__small-1
							| I acted as the critical bridge between the Core Design System Team and the Product Development Team. My responsibility was to ensure that the massive volume of new features being built for Tuenti adhered to global standards while simultaneously feeding new components back into the central library.

					.box__body
						p.font__small-1
							| - Scaling a product ecosystem in a massive enterprise requires strict governance
						p.font__small-1
							| - The Bridge: My team required me to maintain a tight feedback loop between design and development
						p.font__small-1
							| - We had to ship high-volume feature updates without breaking the "Single Source of Truth."
						p.font__small-1
							| - The challenge was not just using the system, but evolving it

						h2.font__small-2 Design System Strategy
					.box__body
						p.font__small-1
							| - The system was built on a User-Centric, Mobile-First philosophy. To scale the ecosystem, we centralized global decisions in a core team, while my role was to apply those guidelines to build tangible experiences.
						p.font__small-1
							| - The Data Viz One of the most complex challenges was the Circular Data Chart—a core component for tracking mobile data usage
						p.font__small-1
							| - Required creating a scalable visual language that was legible on small screens
						p.font__small-1
							| - Required precise collaboration with engineers to ensure the animation and state changes (full vs. empty) were performant and accurate across devices
