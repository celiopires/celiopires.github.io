								| There's always a moment where someone says "this component doesn't fit my team's flow."
								br
								br
								| It happened at 
								a(href='/elespanol.html') El Español
								|  with newsroom modules.
								br
								| At 
								a(href='/commons.html') Commons
								|  inside admin workflows.
								br
								| At 
								a(href='/metallicus.html') Metallicus
								|  when inputs became tricky.
								br
								br
								| I never dismissed it. I asked for the real use case. Sometimes we needed a new variant. Sometimes the flow was unusual and the system wasn't wrong, the logic was. Sometimes we just explained the reasoning behind the decision.

								p.font__small-1
									| Resistance showed up in different ways:
									br
									br
									| • At 
									a(href='/elespanol.html') El Español
									|  with newsroom modules that didn't match editorial workflows
									br
									| • At 
									a(href='/commons.html') Commons
									|  inside admin workflows that had unique requirements
									br
									| • At 
									a(href='/metallicus.html') Metallicus
									|  when inputs became tricky in complex forms
									br
									br
									| Each case was different, but the pattern was the same: someone needed something the system didn't account for.

								h2.font__small-2 The approach
							.box__body
								p.font__small-1
									| I never dismissed it. I asked for the real use case.
									br
									br
									| The response was always:
									br
									| • listen first
									br
									| • understand the actual need
									br
									| • find the solution together
									br
									| • explain the reasoning
									br
									br
									| Sometimes we needed a new variant. Sometimes the flow was unusual and the system wasn't wrong, the logic was. Sometimes we just explained the reasoning behind the decision.

								h2.font__small-2 Solutions
							.box__body
								p.font__small-1
									| The fix depended on the problem:
									br
									br
									| • Sometimes we needed a new variant to handle the edge case
									br
									| • Sometimes the flow was unusual and the system wasn't wrong, the logic was
									br
									| • Sometimes we just explained the reasoning behind the decision
									br
									br
									| Not every request meant changing the system. Sometimes it meant helping people see how it could work for them.

							.box__body
								p.font__small-1
									| Most resistance is not about the component. It's about trust.
									br
									br
									| When someone says "this doesn't work" they're often saying "I don't trust this will work for me." The moment you include people in the fix they switch from resisting the system to defending it.
									br
									br
									| They become advocates. They help others. They keep the system alive.

								| There's always a moment where someone says "this component doesn't fit my team's flow."
								br
								br
								| Most resistance is not about the component. It's about trust.
								br
								br
								| The moment you include people in the fix they switch from resisting the system to defending it. When people feel heard and see their needs addressed, they become the system's strongest advocates. They help others understand it. They keep it relevant.
								br
								br
								| Resistance isn't a problem to solve. It's an opportunity to build trust.
