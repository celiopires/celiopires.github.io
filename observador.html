					<p>Observador’s a Portuguese news web page launched in 2014 targeting all the portuguese speaking people around the globe. I set myself on this journey months before Observador’s first release to be in charge of every design step. Identity, user experience and first design versions were settled previously by some Portuguese design agencies, but major permanent decisions were made after my arrival at Observador’s headquarters. The whole project was carefully thought to be built with the look and feel of a modern online product combining a clean and simple design with the most advanced technology.</p>

				<h2 class="bolder">Design</h2>
				<p>At the top of the most viewed webpages in the country, Observador is a very ambitious Portuguese News page. Went very fast to the top and came up with a variety of fresh new ideas and different formats. Design is based on a 12 column layout for mobile and desktop.</p>
				
				<p>Runs on Wordpress and another powerful open source technologies. In less than a year won the award for the “Best news media website” in the country and after a few more awards was mentioned by the Wordpress community as "A case study around the world" for its very impressive architecture.</p>

				<h2 class="bolder">Tools</h2>
				<p>The working environment needed to be as fast as possible. We were a really small team with a huge responsability of taking our project to another level. Sketch became the main prototyping tool in the year of 2014. Photoshop and Illustrator were also common tools.</p>
