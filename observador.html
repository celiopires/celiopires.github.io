						<h2><em>“A case study around the world”</em> by Wordpress, Portugal</h2>

				<div class="intro__header--bio">
					<p>Observador is fully digital news page launched in the modern era of the internet. It fits responsively into multiple devices and it targets the Portuguese speaking people around the world. Runs on Wordpress and another powerful open source technologies. In less than a year won the award for the “Best news media website” in the country and after a few more awards was mentioned by the Wordpress community as "A case study around the world" for its very impressive architecture.</p>

				<h2 class="bolder">Design</h2>
				<p>At the top of the most viewed webpages in the country, Observador is a very ambitious Portuguese News page. Went very fast to the top and came up with a variety of fresh new ideas and different formats. Design is based on a 12 column layout for mobile and desktop.</p>

				<h2 class="bolder">Problem identification</h2>
				<p>There are no restraints to any who wants to see El Español’s contents. Anyone with an internet connection can do it at any time. The target is the users between the age group of 18 to 70 of both genders.</p>
				<p>The reasons why people are choosing El Español as their main source of information are diverse. Moving from other sources to a subscription model news page means the user really wants to be informed and it pays for a high quality filter that guarantees access only to the best content. Design is the trust, the identity, the interface but essentially it is the experience that will make the user enjoy every moment or it will make him come back later. Design is the front door and it has a lot to do here.</p>

				<h2 class="bolder">Tools</h2>
				<p>In order to achieve goals faster I use this tools everyday. </br> After joining El Español I gathered the courage to attempt always better tools for working. For that reason most of my research as a Designer evolves finding the best tools to improve my workflow. <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/">Sketch</a> is the main tool I use for lo-fi and recently hi-fi prototyping. It allows me to expand its functionalities by using plugins and it is extremely fast, cheap and easy to use. Interactions and experiences are made on <a href="https://origami.design/">Origami Studio</a> and for less complex projects I use <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">Invision</a>.</br>GIT, HTML and SASS are part of my daily tools too.</p>
